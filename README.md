# [jomsh.cc][1]—web root

## Link page, all the rage

These are everywhere now, and they make a lot of sense. They’re like a return to
the 90’s homepage, but no blinking marquees.

Makes for a nice, bite-sized project to practice web development, but with
enough visibility to follow all the way through with fit and finish.

## GitHub Pages

  - [jomsh.cc][1] — `ALIAS` record results in generated `A` records for
    [jomshcc.github.io][3] (`CNAME` flattening)
  - [www.jomsh.cc][2] — `CNAME` to [jomshcc.github.io][3] (and then
    automatically redirects to [jomsh.cc][1])

Any Pages-enabled repositories without their own custom domain config (`CNAME`
file) will appear as subdirectories (`jomsh.cc/REPO/`).
